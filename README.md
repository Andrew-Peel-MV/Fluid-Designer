# FluidDesigner
Using Blender technology as the design engine, Fluid Designer enables you to design kitchens, closets, bathrooms, office spaces, and other interior spaces within a professional, modern drawing environment.  Create powerful 3D presentations, project quotes, renderings, and animated or live walk-throughs. With pre-defined lighting environments, detailed material textures, and on the fly material changes, your projects can go from design to presentation faster than ever before.
